# FVT3DELASTIC

This repository provides a **free** MATLAB implementation of a three-dimensional finite-volume theory (FVT) for stress analysis in linear elastic structures. The formulation is particularly suited for cantilever beam configurations and includes the capability to model C-shaped cross-sections, enabling the analysis of flexural, torsional, or combined flexural-torsional loading. The code offers:

* an efficient and flexible code for conducting numerical investigations in solid mechanics;
* stress and displacement analyses through a local equilibrium-based formulation; and
* easy extension to other problems involving three-dimensional structural components.

## Getting started

Save the [FVT3DELASTIC.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnaldojunioral/FVT3DELASTIC/main/FVT3DELASTIC.m) program (17 kB) and launch MATLAB in the same directory. The program can be executed with the following command:

**FVT3DELASTIC(n1, n2, n3)**

where **n1**, **n2**, and **n3** define the number of subvolumes along the x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, and x<sub>3</sub> directions, respectively. These parameters specify the discretization of the three-dimensional domain, as illustrated in the figure below.
