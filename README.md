**FVT3DELASTIC**

This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of a three-dimensional finite-volume theory (FVT) for stress analysis in linear elastic continua. The formulation is particularly suited for cantilever beam configurations and now includes the capability to model C-shaped cross-sections, enabling the analysis of flexural, torsional, or combined flexural-torsional loading. The code provides an efficient and flexible framework for numerical investigations in solid mechanics.
